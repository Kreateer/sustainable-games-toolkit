# Sustainable Video Game Development Resources

This project aims to maintain a curated list of resources for game developers who want to create more sustainable video games. By providing a centralized location for information on sustainability in game development, we hope to encourage more environmentally conscious practices in the industry.

## Why sustainability in game development matters

Video games are becoming more complex and resource-intensive with each passing year. As game developers work to create larger and more immersive game worlds, the environmental impact of their work increases. Energy consumption, carbon emissions, and electronic waste are just a few of many factors that must be considered when creating video games. By incorporating sustainable practices into game development, we can reduce the environmental impact of the industry while still creating engaging and innovative games.

## Contributing

We encourage contributions to our list of resources! If you have any articles, blogs, tools, or other resources related to sustainability in game development, please add them to the appropriate section in the `README.md` file and submit a pull request. 

We ask that all contributions be relevant to sustainable game development and provide value to game developers who are interested in this topic.
